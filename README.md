# Odin: Library

The _"Library"_ project is part of JavaScript Course in The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript path. In this project, I was introduced to JavaScript objects and prototypes (without using classes). While I expected to focus primarily on object concepts, I ended up reviewing and strengthening my DOM manipulation knowledge/skills LOL. I also got hands-on experience implementing a modal dialog for the first time, so overall this is actually a fun project.
